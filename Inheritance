Inheritance:
- Acquiring properties / methods of one class (Parent class) into another class (Child class) is called Inheritance.
-Inheritance can be acheived using 2 or more classes / two or more interfaces
- To achieve inheritance, we need to use either extends or Implements.

- Extends is used to acquire properties from a parent class into a child class and to extend an interface from another interface. 
  However, extends is not used to acquire properties from a parent interface into a child interface.

- Implements is used to acquire properties from a parent interface into a child class, not a parent class.


Key points in Inheritance:
1. We can hold a child class object with a parent class reference and with that reference we can call ONLY parent class methods / properties.
        ParentClass pc = new ParentClaa();
2. We can hold child class object with parent class reference and with thta reference we can call ONLY parent class methods / properties
        ParentClass pc = new ChildClass ();
3. We can hold a Child class object with a child class reference and with that reference we can call BOTH parent and child class methods / properties  
        ChildClass cc = new ChildClass();
4. We cannot hold a Parent class object with a child class reference. We will get a Compile time error because a child class is not guaranteed to be a parent class instance 
(i.e., it would not be safe to cast a parent class object to a child class reference).
        ChildClass cc = new ParentClass()  ----> Invalid



Types of Inheritance:
1. Single -level => Involves only one parent class and one child class.
2. Multi-level => Involves a chain of classes where a child class inherits from a parent class, and that parent class, in turn, inherits from another class (i.e., a grandparent class). 
   The child class can access methods and properties from both the parent and grandparent classes.
3. Hierarchical => Sharing one parent class properties / methods to multiple child classes.
4. Hybrid => combination of 2 or more types of inheritances.
