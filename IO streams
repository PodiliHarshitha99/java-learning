- An I/O Stream represents an input source or an output destination. A stream can represent many different kinds of sources and destinations, including disk files, devices, other programs, and memory arrays.
- Streams support many different kinds of data, including simple bytes, primitive data types, localized characters, and objects. Some streams simply pass on data; others manipulate and transform the data in useful ways.
- A stream is a sequence of data. A program uses an input stream to read data from a source, one item at a time and A program uses an output stream to write data to a destination, one item at time

4 types of streams:
- Byte streams
- Character streams
- Data streams
- object streams

BYTE STREAMS:
- The data will be converted to the byte form and length of each data packet is of 1 byte.
- Programs use Byte streams to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. All the byte stream classes are descended from InputStream and OutputStream.
byte streams ----> Input Stream -- FileInputStream ---- read()
                   Output Stream -- FileOutputStream ---- write()

read() --> the return type of read() is int. It returns the ASCII values of the characters which care present in the file. NO characters are present in the file, it returns -1.
