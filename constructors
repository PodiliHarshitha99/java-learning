Constructors:
- A constructor in Java Programming is a block of code that initializes (constructs) the state and value during object creation.
- Constructor is a Method used to initialize objects that are called when an object of the class is created  
- It is called every time an object with the help of a new () keyword is created.
- Constructor name should be same as class name
- Constructor will not be having any return type
- We need to initialize a class object with the available constuctors present in out proogram.
- In a java program if we are not writing ant constuctor ie., either parameterized or non-parameterized constructor then the java compiler provides default constructor.
- Default constuctor is exactly same like non-parameterized constructor
- The access modifier fot the default constructor provided by the compiler will be same as the access modifier of the class.
- If the class is public then constuctor is also public. If the class is private, then constructor is also private.
- If we declare a constructor as private, then we can restrict creating an object of our class in other classes
- Just like void methods, we can write a return statement inside a constructor without returning anyting.
- Constructor over loading is possible but overriding is not possible.
